Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</a> is the standard markup language for
<strong><u>documents designed</u> to be displayed in a web browser</strong>.
It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and
scripting languages such as JavaScript.
Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local
storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML
describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally
included cues for the appearance of the document.

HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript</strong>,
which affects the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines
the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former
maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has
encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997
has upended our daily lives.
Youâ€™ve likely been called upon to act, adapt, and rethink how you
manage yourself and others. Now, more than ever, organizations need
resilient leaders who can navigate through turbulent times.
